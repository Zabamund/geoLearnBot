user location ? do something with it 

compare minerals ???

search mineral - done but bug for "not found"
Need to find a way to fix this bug.

add /  button each time new keyboard?

add to collection for each shown mineral?
can do this with single search result .just add and rmove like b4

add better photos

when showing collection, only name and pic so far, add button to get all info?

with browse, maybe add all to collection?

WRITE TESTS!
need to test for main and edge cases
maybe for tests I can set a variable to "update.getM.getC.etc" ?

1. show instructions
2. pick random mineral
3. show 1 hint and keyboard with 4 minerals
4. if guess right 3 points
5. new hint
6. if guess right 2 points
7. new hint
8. if guess right 1 points
