IDEAS FOR GEOLEARNBOT

user location ? do something with it 

compare minerals ???

add /  button each time new keyboard?

add to collection for each shown mineral?
can do this with single search result .just add and rmove like b4

add better photos

when showing collection, only name and pic so far, add button to get all info?

with browse, maybe add all to collection?

WRITE TESTS!
need to test for main and edge cases
maybe for tests I can set a variable to "update.getM.getC.etc" ?


ideas for play track:
1. show instructions
2. pick random mineral
3. show 1 hint and keyboard with 4 minerals
4. if guess right 3 points
5. new hint
6. if guess right 2 points
7. new hint
8. if guess right 1 points
9. new hint
10. if guess right 0 points
* need to keep score for each Chat instance
* need to reset each new game
* keep high score
* reset high score option(for dev?)
when success show mineral and message including score

! BUG ALERT  random mineral selection for game can select same mineral more than once
! Need to STOP game after correct solution


Need to track hints and minerals seen this round in each chat, not as global variable
on start, clear both
on continue, just add questions
"continue is same as start but without resets"
