IDEAS FOR GEOLEARNBOT

user location ? do something with it 

compare minerals ???

add /  button each time new keyboard?

add to collection for each shown mineral?
can do this with single search result .just add and rmove like b4

add better photos

when showing collection, only name and pic so far, add button to get all info?

with browse, maybe add all to collection?

WRITE TESTS!
need to test for main and edge cases
maybe for tests I can set a variable to "update.getM.getC.etc" ?



! BUG ALERT  random mineral selection for game can select same mineral more than once
