IDEAS FOR GEOLEARNBOT

user location ? do something with it 

compare minerals ???

search mineral - done but bug for "not found"
Need to find a way to fix this bug.

add /  button each time new keyboard?

add to collection for each shown mineral?
can do this with single search result .just add and rmove like b4

add better photos

when showing collection, only name and pic so far, add bzuttion to get all info

with browse, maybe add all ?

WRITE TESTS!
need to test for main and edge cases
maybe for tests I can set a variable to "update.getM.getC.etc" ?


create empty array for mineral guesses

ideas for play track:
1. show instructions
2. pick random mineral
3. show 1 hint and keyboard with 4 minerals
4. if guess right 3 points
5. new hint
6. if guess right 2 points
7. new hint
8. if guess right 1 points
9. new hint
10. if guess right 0 points
* need to keep score for each Chat instance
* need to reset each new game
* keep high score
* reset high score option(for dev?)
when success show mineral and message including score
